 * This hook tells Drupal/Tripal about your new field type. Make sure you've
 * created the field (handles basic storage of your data), widget (provides
 * user UI to set data), and formatter (describes display of data on Entity
 * Page) classes. These should be located in the following directory: [your
 * module]/includes/TripalFields/[classname].inc with one file per class. Your
 * field name should be [cv name]__[cvterm name] and the classes should be
 * named [field name], [field_name]_widget, [field name]_formatter for the
 * field, widget and formatter respectively. MAKE SURE YOU'VE CLEARED THE CACHE
 * SINCE ADDING THESE FILES so Tripal magic can find them or the following will
 * fail.
 *
 * @param $entity_type
 *   This should be 'TripalEntity' for all Tripal Content.
 * @param $bundle
 *   This object describes the Type of Tripal Entity (e.g. Organism or Gene)
 *   this hook is being called for. However, since this hook creates field
 *   types (by definition not tied to a specific Tripal Content Type (bundle))
 *   and since a field type will only be created if it doesn't already exist,
 *   this parameter doesn't actually matter. NOTE: If you do need to determine
 *   the bundle in this hook, we suggest inspecting the data_table since the
 *   label can be changed by site administrators.
 *
 * @return
 *   An array of field definitions. Each field in this array will be created if
 *   it doesn't already exist. To trigger create of fields when developing call
 *   tripal_refresh_bundle_fields() for the specific bundle.

 * sure to implement hook_bundle_create_fields() to create your field type
 * before trying to create an instance of that field.

 *   This object describes the Type of Tripal Entity (e.g. Organism or Gene)
 *   the field instances are being created for. Thus this hook is called once
 *   per Tripal Content Type on your site. The name of the bundle is the
 *   machine name of the type (e.g. bio_data_1) and the label of the bundle
 *   (e.g. Organism) is what you see in the interface. Since the label can be
 *   changed by site admin, we suggest checking the data_table to determine if
 *   this is the entity you want to add field instances to.
 *
 * @return
 *   An array of field instance definitions. This is where you can define the
 *   defaults for any settings you use in your field. Each entry in this array
 *   will be used to create an instance of an already existing field.
